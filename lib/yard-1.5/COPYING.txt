YARD is all original work.  While it may rely on standard libraries, YARD does
not include code from other sources.  We have chosen to release our work as
public domain code.  This means that YARD has been released outside the
copyright system.  Feel free to use the code in any way you wish.

However, especially in an academic setting, plagiarism has very little to do
with copyright.  In an academic paper, or in any situation where you are
expected to give credit to other people's work, you will need to cite YARD as
a source.  The author is Christopher Diggins, and the appropriate date is
December 2004 -- the release date for Yard 1.0 (depending on your citation
format, you may also need to state which date you accessed the files).

While we welcome bug reports and feature requests, we can't make any promises
regarding whether YARD will do what you want, or whether we will make any
changes you ask for.  You are free to hire your own expert for that.

If you choose to distribute YARD commercially, you'll probably want to read up
on the laws covering warranties in your state, especially the implied
warranties of fitness for a particular use or merchantability.
