The YARD C++ programming library is used to create parsers using
C++ templates to express the parsing rules. YARD is extremely small
and efficient. The design goals of YARD is to be easy to modify
and extend, rather than provide all possible functionality out of the
box.

YARD is a header-only library, so there is no need to link the final
binaries to anything. The root include file is "include/yard.hpp"

Bug reports and feature requests can be entered at YARD's Sourceforge
page.  Feel free to contact Max Lybbert at mlybbert@users.sourceforge.net or
Christopher Diggins cdiggins@gmail.com.

There is a tutorial available online at
http://yard-parser.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/index.cgi?dest=Documents&doc=tutorial
and a FAQ at http://code.google.com/p/yardparser/wiki/MainFAQ .
